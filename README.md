code up to this point coming from :

https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-self-driving-autonomous-cars-carla-python/?fbclid=IwAR3r0_QOVQBMQAiiluF5MtEprn_uaPmQVLkEsLXcRRzEu0_X0EOvtFbpwqY

additional comments have been put and code separated into multiple classes

## What you need
Before being able to go further and run the code, it is necessary that you download everything needed to run carla 
https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start_quickstart/

Secondly, you need to download python 3.7 as Carla latest version for windows is only available for python 3.7. 

## Steps to gets started 
You may follow the videos 1 and 2 of the first link to get started as they show you how to start the simulation, how to spawn cars and even ride your own car in the environment. 

When you have got acquanted with it, follow the third video that explains you how to spawn your own car (make it go straight for 5 seconds and then dissapear. When you are done, you will be able to follow the reinforcement learning. 

As said before, I have already written all the code that has been written during the videos, however I have separated them to have a better visibility.
